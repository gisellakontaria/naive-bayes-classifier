# Naive-Bayes Classifier
## Project Description
* This project builds a Naive Bayes classification model that can classify user's handwritten drawing as a number 0-9. 
* User handwrites the number on the sketchpad provided on the screen.

## Steps Taken
* Find pre-labeled data files that will be used for training and validation data.
* Train the classifier using Bayes' theorem statistical formula. The goal of the training stage is to teach the computer the likelihood that a pixel is either shaded (1) or not shaded (0) for each one of the classes 0-9.
* Perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) classification of the test data using the trained model to classify the image into a class.
* Validates the output of the model and calculate the % accuracy of the classifier.
